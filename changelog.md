### Changes Made to Portfolio Site
- Modified the width of the doodle of me and the width of the site logo to be in relative units (% unit) so that both images adjust to screen size change.
- Implemented light/dark mode option with JS which allows for user to click on an icon and change the color scheme of site.
- Added styling (underline + bold) to the navigation bar item corresponding to current page with JS
- Added a thank you dialog in the contact page that appears when user submits form with JS. (Form submission is currently not processed, however. I believe that will be assignment 5.)

### 3rd Party Script
- Included Google Analytics since I wanted to track how users use my site. As the target audience for my site consist of recruiters and potential job employers, I want to be able to track what page garnered the most attention and what page was lacking in interest. I also want to track how engaged they are with site as my goal is to have them stay long enough to become interested in me as an employee. Google Analytics provides data for all of this and allows me track how engaged users are with my site. Thus as Google Analytics fulfills my ideals, I implemented Google Analytics into my site.
